                 The money on cosmetics and photoshopping images only increases the hours spent in anxiety.

                           is losing solidity as people with anxiety often appear to just be ‘fine’.

                           News of the oil spill is wrapped around the victimized otter to 
                           illustrate how currently, disasters are marine life’s only protection from the ghastly white hands that represent the apathetic citizens. The fingers all bring oil to the otter, as seen by the black oil around and on the tips of the fingers, because we are all a part of the problem. We often place the blame on big corporations, but it is everyone’s responsibility 
                           to protect nature’s life source. Ultimately, the fingers, the people, have the power to take back the oil and defeat ignorance.
